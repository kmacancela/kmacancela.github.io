  For the past year, I have been religiously telling my friends and family that I am going to create iOS applications and make my app ideas into a reality. However, I had not applied myself in learning Swift and Xcode in order to accomplish this. Until now! I found a YouTube channel, called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2D6eRvCeMtcF5OGHf1-trw">Code With Chris</a>, that has the ideal step-by-step pace for beginners.

  I am currently halfway through the tutorials but Chris has allowed me to create several iOS applications already which can be viewed in my GitHub. At first he will show you how to work with the storyboard in order to create a dynamic UI. Afterwards, he will dive into the coding aspects so you can manipulate your UI and achieve an interactive application.
