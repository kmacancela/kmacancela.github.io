    This project focuses on building a virtual portal for a pet clinic, managing incoming appointments, and publishing upcoming appointments. Pet owners can log in and select which vet they wish to see for their pet and the date and time they choose. Using JavaScript and AJAX, the pet owner are able to view upcoming appointments and have the option to cancel. Pet owners are also able to rate their experience after an appointment has been marked as completed. Vets are able to log in and view their upcoming appointments. Using Java, HQL, Spring, and Hibernate as the back end, I used ORM to map our POJO to our relational database.<br><i>Note: Data is not displayed in demo because I do not have my AWS RDS running.</i>

  <sub>
    I was responsible for building APIs for the development of Aetna’s mobile application that serves over 18 million individuals all across United States. As part of an application development scrum team, I collaborated in daily scrum meetings through presentations and brainstorming sessions, development of a PHI microservice, and improvement of the mobile UI design. I worked with Java, HTML, and CSS and tools such as IBM RAD, Splunk, IBM APIC, and Git. I was instrumental in bringing new perspective by introducing the team to microservices. I successfully brought my scrum team members up to date with how efficiency can be improved by decomposing a large application into loosely coupled services and allowing the workload to be divided by separate development teams.

    This project is a tool that manages hospital patients and records, including medicine inventory and prescription. By creating several APIs and utilizing Eureka, APIs for Medicine, Patient, and User Records, are able to be accessed and modified separately because they are each microservices. Zuul acts as an API gateway and delegates the requests to these microservices.
