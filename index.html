    This project focuses on building a virtual portal for a pet clinic, managing incoming appointments, and publishing upcoming appointments. Pet owners can log in and select which vet they wish to see for their pet and the date and time they choose. Using JavaScript and AJAX, the pet owner are able to view upcoming appointments and have the option to cancel. Pet owners are also able to rate their experience after an appointment has been marked as completed. Vets are able to log in and view their upcoming appointments. Using Java, HQL, Spring, and Hibernate as the back end, I used ORM to map our POJO to our relational database.
