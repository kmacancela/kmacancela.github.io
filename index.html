    Hey there, I'm Karina. I am a Software Developer and a contemporary artist living in NYC. As a programmer, I focus on creating Java programs for clients. I have worked with frameworks such as Spring and Hibernate to create microservices and with languages such as Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and SQL. I am also learning Swift in order to create iOS applications and make my app ideas into a reality soon. You can find out more in my <a href="https://github.com/kmacancela">GitHub</a> and my <a href="/assets/docs/resume.pdf">resume</a>.

    I have always been a curious individual, interested in various subjects with a desire to positively contribute to the community. I became interested in programming when I learned HTML and CSS at 14 in order to create a website where I could connect with teens around the country. I went to LaGuardia Arts High School as an art major student and learned how to express myself as an artist. I believe that learning how to create my ideas as an artist helped me realize that I wanted to create something that could help others. As a developer, I will create iOS applications which can accomplish this goal of mine.
    <br><br>
    Besides developing, I am a passionate painter and aspiring cartoonist. I primarily paint portraits and landscapes. I am also currently working on creating iOS stickers.
