    <b>Hey there, I'm Karina.</b> I am a software developer, mathematician, and artist living in New York City. As a developer with 5 years of experience, I focus on creating full-stack web applications from start to production-ready for a wide range of clients. With dual degrees in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics plus completing two immersive engineering bootcamps, I know I can face anything in my tracks! 
    <br><br>
    To give you a taste of my current expertise, I have worked with frameworks such as Ruby on Rails, Angular, Express.js, Spring, Hibernate, and Bootstrap and with languages & libraries such as Java, JavaScript, React, Ruby, Node.js, HTML, CSS, Sequelize, and SQL. I have utilized tools like Azure, GTM, Google Ads, Bing Ads, Facebook Business Manager, The Trade Desk, Invoca, AWS, DevOps, Git, Postman, and Jenkins to make my developer life much easier. You can check out some of my work in my <a href="https://github.com/kmacancela">GitHub</a>!

    I have always been a curious individual, interested in various subjects with a desire to positively contribute to the community. What can I say? I have a hunger to keep on learning and expanding! I became interested in programming when I learned HTML and CSS at fourteen in order to create a website where I could connect with other teens around the country. I went to LaGuardia Arts High School as an art major student and learned how to express myself as an artist using different forms of medium. I believe that learning how to create my ideas into a reality helped me realize that I want to be an inspiration and produce something innovative that could help others.

    Besides coding, I am a passionate painter and aspiring cartoonist. I enjoy painting portraits and landscapes and I am currently working on creating iOS stickers. I enjoy the outdoors and traveling. There's so much on this planet and so little time therefore every day is precious! I am an energetic person who loves to constantly be learning and refining what I already know, therefore I always look forward to being part of a work environment and team that aligns with my passion!
