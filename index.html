      First version of a game web application where users can start with a balance, depending on difficulty, search and buy stocks with the help of <a href="https://www.alphavantage.co/">Alpha Vantage API</a>. This API fetches real data based on month and year of each stock. Users can choose up to 5 stocks and they will find out if they made or lost money when done. The second half of this web application is still getting built. Stay tuned for version 2.0 of this web application. This app was built with Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, SQLite, and Alpha Vantage API.

  <h1>Pet Clinic</h1>

    <sub>
      This project focuses on building a virtual portal for a pet clinic - managing incoming appointments and displaying upcoming appointments. Pet owners can log in and select which vet they wish to see for their pet and the date and time they choose. Using JavaScript and AJAX, the pet owner are able to view upcoming appointments and have the option to cancel. Pet owners are also able to rate their experience after an appointment has been marked as completed. Vets are able to log in and view their upcoming appointments. Using Java, HQL, Spring, and Hibernate as the back end, I used ORM to map our POJO to our relational database.
      <br><i>Note: Data is not displayed in demo because I do not have my AWS RDS running.</i>

  <h1>Aetna's Mobile Application</h1>

    <sub>
      I was responsible for building APIs for the development of Aetna’s mobile application that serves over 18 million individuals all across United States. As part of an application development scrum team, I collaborated in daily scrum meetings through presentations and brainstorming sessions, development of a PHI microservice, and improvement of the mobile UI design. I worked with Java, HTML, and CSS and tools such as IBM RAD, Splunk, IBM APIC, and Git. I was instrumental in bringing new perspective by introducing the team to microservices. I successfully brought my scrum team members up to date with how efficiency can be improved by decomposing a large application into loosely coupled services and allowing the workload to be divided by separate development teams.
