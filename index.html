    Hey there, I'm Karina. I am a software developer and a contemporary artist living in NYC. As a developer, I have focused on creating Java applications for clients. I have worked with frameworks such as Spring and Hibernate to create microservices and with languages such as Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and SQL. I am also currently learning Swift and Python on my own. You can find out more in my <a href="https://github.com/kmacancela">GitHub</a> and my <a href="/assets/docs/Karina%20Macancela%20-%20Resume.pdf">resume</a>.

    I have always been a curious individual, interested in various subjects with a desire to positively contribute to the community. I became interested in programming when I learned HTML and CSS at fourteen in order to create a website where I could connect with other teens around the country. I went to LaGuardia Arts High School as an art major student and learned how to express myself as an artist using different forms of medium. I believe that learning how to create my ideas as an artist helped me realize that I want to produce something innovative that could help others. I am accomplishing this by learning Swift in order to create iOS applications and make several app ideas I have into a reality soon.
    <br><br>
    Besides coding, I am a passionate painter and aspiring cartoonist. I enjoy painting portraits and landscapes and I am currently working on creating iOS stickers. I enjoy the outdoors and traveling. There's so much on this planet and so little time therefore every day is precious! I am a very energetic individual overall who loves to constantly be learning and growing, therefore I look forward to finding a work environment and team that aligns with who I am.
