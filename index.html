      This is the first version of a web application built by software engineers, Karina Macancela and Belle Poopongpanit. This app aims to allow users to create a profile to find and create events based on location and category. Users can add comments on each event. Users can edit and delete their account (along with their comments). User can find their events on their dashboard. Utilized JavaScript, Ruby on Rails, bcrypt, Bootstrap, SQLite, and jQuery.
      <br><i>Future goals: Will be adding Eventbrite and StubHub APIs to suggest events to users around their area.</i>

  <h1>Pet Clinic</h1>

    <sub>
      This project focuses on building a virtual portal for a pet clinic - managing incoming appointments and displaying upcoming appointments. Pet owners can log in and select which vet they wish to see for their pet and the date and time they choose. Using JavaScript and AJAX, the pet owner are able to view upcoming appointments and have the option to cancel. Pet owners are also able to rate their experience after an appointment has been marked as completed. Vets are able to log in and view their upcoming appointments. Using Java, HQL, Spring, and Hibernate as the back end, I used ORM to map our POJO to our relational database.
      <br><i>Note: Data is not displayed in demo because I do not have my AWS RDS running.</i>

  <h1>Aetna's Mobile Application</h1>

    <sub>
      I was responsible for building APIs for the development of Aetna’s mobile application that serves over 18 million individuals all across United States. As part of an application development scrum team, I collaborated in daily scrum meetings through presentations and brainstorming sessions, development of a PHI microservice, and improvement of the mobile UI design. I worked with Java, HTML, and CSS and tools such as IBM RAD, Splunk, IBM APIC, and Git. I was instrumental in bringing new perspective by introducing the team to microservices. I successfully brought my scrum team members up to date with how efficiency can be improved by decomposing a large application into loosely coupled services and allowing the workload to be divided by separate development teams.
