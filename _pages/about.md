Welcome to my portfolio! I am creative and curious by nature which is why I love being a Software Developer. I focus on Java, JavaScript, SQL, and Swift. My current projects involve creating iOS mobile applications. Besides developing, I am a passionate painter, bookworm junkie, and an amateur cook & baker.
