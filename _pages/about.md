    <b>Hey there, I'm Karina.</b> I am a software developer and a contemporary artist living in NYC. As a developer, I have focused on creating applications for clients, ranging from developing microservices to designing a creative and dynamic UI. I have worked with frameworks such as Spring, Hibernate, and Bootstrap and with languages such as Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and SQL. I am also currently learning Swift, Ruby on Rails, and Python on my own. I have worked with tools like AWS, DevOps, Git, and Jenkins.

You could also find more details about my role in several projects by visiting <a href="/assets/docs/Karina%20Macancela%20-%20Projects.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.
    <br><br>
    I have always been a curious individual, interested in various subjects with a desire to positively contribute to the community. I became interested in programming when I learned HTML and CSS at fourteen in order to create a website where I could connect with other teens around the country. I went to LaGuardia Arts High School as an art major student and learned how to express myself as an artist using different forms of medium. I believe that learning how to create my ideas into a reality helped me realize that I want to produce something innovative that could help others. One of the many ways I am accomplishing this is by learning Swift in order to create iOS applications.
    <br><br>
    Besides coding, I am a passionate painter and aspiring cartoonist. I enjoy painting portraits and landscapes and I am currently working on creating iOS stickers. I enjoy the outdoors and traveling. There's so much on this planet and so little time therefore every day is precious! I am a very energetic individual overall who loves to constantly be learning and growing, therefore I look forward to finding a work environment and team that aligns with who I am and who I aspire to become.
